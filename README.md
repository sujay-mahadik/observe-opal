# Observe OPAL Plugin

A Claude plugin for teams using [Observe](https://www.observeinc.com/). This plugin helps you write, debug, explain, and learn OPAL queries, convert Logstash events arriving via the `/elastic` endpoint into production-ready metric interfaces, and migrate Logstash Grok patterns to OPAL `extract_regex` statements.

## Skills

### `opal-query` — OPAL Query Assistant

Helps with everything OPAL-related:

- **Write queries** — describe what you want to observe in plain language and get a working OPAL pipeline
- **Extract fields** — paste a raw log line (CLF, syslog, app logs) and get `extract_regex` statements to parse every field
- **Explain queries** — walk through an existing query clause by clause
- **Debug queries** — diagnose why a query fails or returns unexpected results
- **Onboard** — guided introduction to OPAL for engineers new to Observe

**Trigger phrases:** "write an OPAL query", "explain this query", "debug my OPAL", "extract fields from this log", "how do I filter by pod", "count errors per service", "show me latency by namespace"

### `json-event-to-metric` — JSON Event → Observe Metrics

Converts any raw JSON event — from Logstash, Filebeat, Metricbeat, Elastic Agent, any Beats shipper, or any other JSON source — into a complete, efficient OPAL pipeline that outputs an `interface "metric"` dataset. Handles field classification, metric/tag separation, timestamp parsing, and `flatten_leaves` patterns.

**Trigger phrases:** "json event to observe metrics", "elastic event to observe metrics", "convert my event", "convert my elastic event", "turn this event into a metric", "ingest data as observe metric", "ingest elastic data as observe metric", "logstash event to observe", "metricbeat to observe metric", "filebeat to observe metric", "elastic agent to observe", "beats to observe", "create a metric dataset", "how do I make a metric from this JSON", "identify which fields are metrics vs tags", "my data comes from logstash", "I'm sending data via the elastic endpoint"

### `grok-to-opal` — Grok Pattern Converter

Converts Logstash Grok patterns and filters into equivalent OPAL `extract_regex` statements. Supports all ecs-v1 patterns, type casting (`:int`, `:float`), ECS nested field name normalization (`[http][response][status_code]` → `http_response_status_code`), and includes pre-built translations for common log formats (Apache, Syslog, Tomcat, AWS, HAProxy, PostgreSQL, and more).

**Trigger phrases:** "convert this grok", "translate grok to OPAL", "migrate grok filter", "grok pattern in OPAL", "what is the OPAL equivalent of this grok", "rewrite this grok as an extract_regex"

## What's covered

The `opal-query` skill includes a comprehensive reference (`references/syntax.md`) covering all 74 active OPAL verbs and key functions, including:

- All projection verbs: `filter`, `make_col`, `pick_col`, `drop_col`, `rename_col`, `extract_regex`
- Aggregation: `statsby`, `timechart`, `timestats`, `aggregate`
- Joins: `join`, `leftjoin`, `fulljoin`, `lookup`, `union`, `follow`, `surrounding`
- Data shaping: `flatten_leaves`, `flatten`, `unpivot`, `pivot`, `topk`, `bottomk`, `sort`, `dedup`
- Time: `set_timestamp`, `set_valid_from`, `parse_isotime`, `timestamp_s/ms/us/ns`
- Objects: `make_object`, `drop_fields`, `select_fields`, `parse_json`, `parse_kvp`, `parse_url`
- Strings: `get_regex`, `contains`, `split_string`, `replace_regex`, `upper`, `lower`, and more
- Window functions: `lag`, `lead`, `rank`, `row_number`, `ntile`
- Type casts, conditional functions, numeric and array functions

## Usage

### OPAL queries

Just describe your goal in plain language:

> "Write an OPAL query to count 5xx errors per service in the last hour"

> "Extract the client IP, method, path, and status code from this nginx log:
> `10.0.0.9 - - [28/Mar/2026:10:22:15 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 312`"

> "Debug this query — it's returning no data: `filter status_code > 400 | timechart 5m, count:count()`"

### Elastic event → Observe metric conversion

Paste a sample event and ask to convert it:

> "My data comes from Logstash into Observe using the /elastic endpoint. Here's a sample event — turn it into a metric interface."

> "I'm using Metricbeat to send data to Observe. Can you build a metric dataset from this event?"

The skill will classify every field, choose the right pattern (union, `make_object` + `flatten_leaves`, or single-metric), and output a complete pipeline.

### Grok → OPAL conversion

Paste a Grok pattern and ask to convert it:

> "Convert this grok to OPAL: `%{IPORHOST:client_ip} %{USER:ident} %{USER:username} \[%{HTTPDATE:timestamp}\] \"%{WORD:http_method} %{URIPATH:url} HTTP/%{NUMBER:http_version}\" %{NUMBER:status_code:int} %{NUMBER:bytes_sent:int}`"

The skill expands every `%{PATTERN:field:type}` token, preserves literals, handles optional fields, and emits a complete `extract_regex` statement with a timestamp pipeline when needed.

## Datasets supported

- **Kubernetes Logs** — `body`, `pod`, `namespace`, `container`, `cluster`, `attributes`
- **Tracing / Spans** — `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration`, `service_name`, `error`, `attributes`
- **Metrics** — any metric dataset
- **Logstash / Elastic ingest** — events arriving via `/elastic` with top-level `FIELDS` column

---

## Requirements

No external services or environment variables required. The plugin works entirely from the skills' built-in knowledge.
